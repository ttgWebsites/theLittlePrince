					<li data-theme="d">The Little Prince was originally written in French, however its wide 
					popularity has led to it being published all around the world in many different languages. 
					The story begins with the narrator telling of an experience when he was young. He had drawn 
					a picture of a boa constrictor eating an elephant, yet every adult he showed misinterpreted 
					it as a hat. He gave up on his drawings due to his frustration. As an adult he became a pilot, 
					and one day crash lands in the Sahara desert where he meets the Little Prince. The prince is the 
					only person who sees his childhood drawing for what it is. The two strike a friendship, and the reader
					then learns the prince is from outer space and lived on an asteroid. He tells of his life on the asteroid, 
					and his experiences on Earth since then. Eventually the story returns back to the present in 
					the desert, and the prince has decided to allow a snake to bite him in hopes to return to his asteroid.
					The prince collapses and the narrator is distressed, however the next day the prince's body is missing. 
					The narrator searches for him, yet he is no where to be found leaving one wondering if the prince ever 
					made it back, or if maybe this was all a mirage.</li>
